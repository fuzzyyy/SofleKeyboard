Sofle is 6Ã—4+5 keys column-staggered split keyboard with encoder support. Based on [Lily58](https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58), [Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) and [Helix](https://github.com/MakotoKurauchi/helix) keyboards.

SofleKeyboard was created by [Josef Adamcik](https://josef-adamcik.cz/). The motivation and process is covered in following blog-post: [Let me introduce you SofleKeyboard - a split keyboard based on Lily58 and Crkbd](https://josef-adamcik.cz/electronics/let-me-introduce-you-sofle-keyboard-split-keyboard-based-on-lily58.html)

It is still in [development](https://github.com/josefadamcik/SofleKeyboard/tree/develop), but the first version gained some popularity and there was even some group buys.

[Build guide is here]({{ baseurl }}/SofleKeyboard/build_guide.html).

If you are interested in building the board and don't want to bother with KiCad, the gerber files are available in [releases](https://github.com/josefadamcik/SofleKeyboard/releases).
